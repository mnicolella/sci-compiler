# Sierra Creative Interpreter Script Compiler

The Sierra Creative Interpreter (SCI) Script Compiler is now available as an open-source project under the MIT License. Originally developed under proprietary ownership by Codemasters and subsequently transferred to the current license holder, Digital Alchemy Studios LLC, this release marks the transition of the project from closed-source to open-source.

This project was forked by Michael Nicolella in 2025 to port it to modern systems and make it more usable by the community.
